/**
 * @fileoverview This file serves as the single source of truth for all Airtable
 * table names and field IDs used throughout the Aether application.
 *
 * Centralizing the schema here offers several benefits:
 * 1.  Maintainability: If a field name or ID changes in Airtable, it only needs to be updated in this one file.
 * 2.  Readability: Code becomes more readable, e.g., `FIELDS.MEMBERS.FULL_NAME` instead of a cryptic field ID.
 * 3.  Consistency: Ensures all parts of the application refer to the same fields, reducing errors.
 * 4.  Discoverability: Provides a clear overview of the entire data model for developers.
